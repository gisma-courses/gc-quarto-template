# Basics


Currently several WiFi Hubs with varying sensors and one base station each are connected via LoRa radio. The base station is equipped with wind vector, precipitation irradiance and temperature/humidity sensors. The WiFi Hub in turn uses any accessible WLAN to pass on the data via mobile network to a data server.
